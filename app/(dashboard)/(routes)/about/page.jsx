            <strong>Easy File Upload:</strong> With ShareLit, you can quickly
            upload your files with just a few clicks. Our intuitive interface
            ensures that you can get your files uploaded and ready to share
            without any hassle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Sharing:</strong> Security is our top priority. Each
            file you upload can be protected with a unique password. This
            ensures that only the intended recipient can access your files,
            providing you with peace of mind.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Personalized Sharing:</strong> Once your file is uploaded,
            ShareLit generates a short URL that you can easily share. You can
            send this link to your recipient, who will then use the provided
            password to access the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Email Integration:</strong> You can directly send the file
            link to your recipient's email from within the ShareLit app. This
            streamlines the sharing process and ensures that your files are
            delivered to the right person.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Recent Files:</strong> Our "Files" page keeps track of your
            recent uploads, making it easy for you to manage and re-share your
            files whenever necessary.
          </li>

          How It Works
        </h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-md mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Upload Your File:</strong> Simply drag and drop your file or
            select it from your device.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Set a Password:</strong> Protect your file by setting a
            unique password. Only those with the password will be able to access
            the file.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Share the Link:</strong> Share the generated short URL with
            your recipient via email or any other communication channel.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Secure Access:</strong> The recipient uses the link and the
            password to securely download the file.
          </li>
        </ol>
